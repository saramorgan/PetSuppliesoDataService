# PetSuppliesoDataService
Tutorial Code from an article posted on DeveloperForce about Accessing a SQL Server Azure Database using Lightning Connect
Created by: Sara Morgan Nettles

This is a Visual Studio 2013 solution that contains an ASP.NET Web Application project. The project code includes an Entity Framework Model that was built from a SQL Server Azure database containing a single table named Supplies. The project also includes a WCF Data Service that exposes the database as oData. This solution was built as a proof of concept application to demonstrate how to build a Do it yourself Data Producer that exposes SQL Server Azure data as read-only oData. It was part of an article that was posted on DeveloperForce at the following link: https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2015/03/accessing-sql-server-azure-database-lightning-connect.html
